Update (04/10): helpers.py and folder.py have been removed and must be downloaded separately. <br>
Steps:
- git clone https://github.com/arachid1/gemd_tools in your desired location
- - Suggested: add as sibling folder to your working directory <=> have identical parent folder as the working directory
- editing 'gemd_tools_path' variable for 'sys.path.append(gemd_tools_path)' command at the top of modelling.ipynb
